## üìå Overview
This repository contains code and experiments exploring **dynamic learning rate scheduler** to improve training stability and performance for:

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**  
- **Image Classification Models**

The work investigates DLRS adaptive scheduling strategies that respond to training dynamics, aiming to enhance convergence speed, reduce overfitting, and boost accuracy.


## üöÄ Features

- Modular **dynamic learning rate scheduler** implementation
- Example training pipelines for PINNs and image classification tasks
- Pre-configured experiment scripts with reproducible settings
- Easy-to-extend dlrs module for other deep learning tasks


## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshwinRaikar88/dynamic-learning-rate-scheduler.git
cd dynamic-learning-rate-scheduler
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
